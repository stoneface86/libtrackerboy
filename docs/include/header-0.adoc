== Header

The header structure provides valuable information about the data stored in
the payload, as well as versioning information.

The table below defines the layout of the Header structure. Reminder that all
multi-byte fields are stored in little-endian. The size of the header is a
fixed 160 bytes, with any unused space marked as reserved. Reserved fields can
be utilized for future revisions of the format.

The layout of the header depends on the header revision, located in offset 24.
The following table is for the current revision of the specification.
