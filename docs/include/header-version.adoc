=== Version (major, minor, patch)

Version information is stored as three 4-byte words. This information
determines which version of trackerboy that created the file. Versioning is
maintained by keeping a major and minor version, followed by a patch number.
For example, if the trackerboy version is v1.0.2, then the header's version
fields will contain `0x1` `0x0` and `0x2` for major, minor and patch,
respectively.
