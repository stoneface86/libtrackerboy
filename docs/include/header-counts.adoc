=== icount, scount and wcount

icount:: instrument count
scount:: song count
wcount:: waveform count

These counter fields determine the number of INST, SONG and WAVE blocks present
in the payload, respectively. `icount` and `wcount` can range from 0-64 and is
unbiased. `scount` can range from 0-255 and is biased (a value of 0 means there
is 1 SONG block).
