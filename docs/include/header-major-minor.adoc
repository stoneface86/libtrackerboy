=== Major revision (m. rev)

This version number indicates a breaking change for the file format. Starts
at 0 and is incremented whenever the layout of the header or payload changes.
TrackerBoy will not attempt to read modules with a newer major version, but can
attempt to read older versions (backwards-compatible).

Examples of breaking changes:

- Modifying the layout of the Header structure
- Adding/removing blocks to the payload
- Modifying the format of a payload block

=== Minor revision (n. rev)

This version number indicates a change in the format that is forward-compatible
with older versions. Changes such as utilizing a reserved field in the header.

NOTE: TrackerBoy can read any module file as long as its major revision is
      less than or equal to the current revision. Saving always uses the
      current revision, so saving an older major version is a one-way
      upgrade.
