=== WAVE block format

A WAVE block contains the data for a single waveform. The data
is structured in this order:

1. The waveform's id, `Uint8`
2. The waveform's name, `LString`
3. The waveform's data, a 16 byte array of packed 4-bit PCM samples

==== id and name

Same as `INST` blocks, the `WAVE` block's data begins with the waveform's id
and name.

==== Waveform data

Next is the waveform's data, a 16 byte array of 32 4-bit PCM samples, with the
same layout as the Game Boy's CH3 Wave RAM. The first sample in the waveform is
the upper nibble of the first byte in the array, whereas the last sample is the
lower nibble of the last byte in the array.

The waveform data ends the `WAVE` block.
