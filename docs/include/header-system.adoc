=== System

The system field determines which Game Boy model this module is for. Since the
driver is typically updated every vblank, the system field determines the
framerate, tick rate or vblank interval for the driver. The available choices
are listed in the following table:

[cols="3,1,3,3"]
|===
| Identifier | Value | System name | Tick rate

| systemDmg
| 0
| DMG
| 59.7 Hz

| systemSgb
| 1
| SGB
| 61.1 Hz

| systemCustom
| 2
| N/A
| varies

|===

If the system is `systemCustom`, then a custom tick rate is used instead of the
system's vblank. The custom tick rate is stored in the `customFramerate` field
of the header.

By default the DMG system, `systemDmg`, is selected.
