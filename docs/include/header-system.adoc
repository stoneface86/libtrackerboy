=== System

The system field determines which Game Boy model this module is for. Since the
driver is typically updated every vblank, the system field determines the
framerate, tick rate or vblank interval for the driver. The available choices
are listed in the following table:

.Valid system values
[cols="3,1,3,3"]
|===
| Identifier   | Value | System name | Tick rate
| systemDmg    | 0     | DMG         | 59.7 Hz
| systemSgb    | 1     | SGB         | 61.1 Hz
| systemCustom | 2     | N/A         | varies
|===

If the system is `systemCustom`, then a custom tick rate is used instead of the
system's vblank. The custom tick rate is stored in the `customFramerate` field
of the header. This custom tick rate must be a positive number and nonzero. The
implementation should default to 30 fps when the custom tick rate does not meet
this criteria.

If the system does not match any of these values, then the implementation
should treat the system as the default, `systemDmg`.
