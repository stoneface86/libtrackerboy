=== Author information (title, artist, copyright)

These fields in the header are fixed 32 byte strings. Assume ASCII encoding.
Any unused characters in the string should be set to 0 or `\0`. Since these
strings are fixed, null-termination is not needed.

NOTE: The size and naming of these strings are identical to the ones in *.gbs
      file format. This is intentional, as exporting to gbs is a planned
      feature.
