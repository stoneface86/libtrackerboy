# Changelog

## [0.7.0] - 2022-11-09

Initial version of the Nim rewrite, also the canonical first version of the
library.

## Before v0.7.0

All code before v0.7.0  is UNVERSIONED, or rather, used trackerboy's versioning.
This is due to the fact that the back end was originally in the same repo as
the front end, and thus used the same version history.

All code before v0.7.0 is also known as "before Nim", where the original
implementation of this library was in C++.
